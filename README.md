# Object Oriented Programming
## OOP
Revolves around the idea of creating objects that encapsulate data and behaviour. Objects interact with data/other objects through methods. There are 4 principles of OOP: 
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Encapsulation
Bundling common data and behaviour in single entity called an object is called Encapsulation. It hides all the internal details from the outisde world and provides methods to interact with other objects/data. Provides data protection and modification of member data through controller methods. 

> Example: Before the existence of mobile phones, there was a pager for messaging, and telephone for calls. These common functionalities have been bundled up in one single entity called the mobile phone.

## Abstraction
Hiding all the complex functionalities and providing a simple interface for the user is called an abstraction. 

> Example: A mobile phone call involves a lot of complex procedures like using the antenna bands to reach the nearest mobile tower and so on, but the user is only exposed to one call button.

## Inheritance 
Allows to inherit properties and methods from other classes. Can create specialised classes from generic classes. 

> Example: A vehicle class could be inherited by a car class, truck class, bike class


## Polymorphism 
Morphism means to change, and poly means many. Polymorphism is when an entity behaves like another entity. 

> Example: An animal class could be inherited by a Dog class and a Cat class. The same method sound() in animal class, "makes a sound". But in dog class, "barks" and in cat class, "meows".
