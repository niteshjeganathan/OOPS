# Object Oriented Programming
## OOP
Revolves around the idea of creating objects that encapsulate data and behaviour. Objects interact with data/other objects through methods. There are 4 principles of OOP: 
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Encapsulation
Bundling common data and behaviour in single entity called an object is called Encapsulation. It hides all the internal details from the outisde world and provides methods to interact with other objects/data. Provides data protection and modification of member data through controller methods. 

> Example: Before the existence of mobile phones, there was a pager for messaging, and telephone for calls. These common functionalities have been bundled up in one single entity called the mobile phone.
